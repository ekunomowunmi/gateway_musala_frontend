## Running unit tests

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

## Blockers

As I could not get past the CORS error, I just created static views with UI, but you could see some of the commented code in the 
services that tried to communicate with the server

Merry Christmas
